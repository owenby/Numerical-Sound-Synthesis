The examples in this folder show a 3 types of possible simulations. The best sounding of which is the stiff lossy string, it lacks the 'ringing' of the frequency dependent loss simulation, and sounds very similar to a real, short string. 

Sample rate: 44100
Boundary Conditions: Fixed

Lossless String: A string with no loss or stiffness. Excited with a pluck in the centre. Wave speed: 600

Frequency Dependent Loss String: A string with 2 loss terms (b0=1.8, b1=0.2). Excited with a pluck in the centre. Wave speed: 500

Stiff, Lossy String: A string with 2 loss terms and a stiffness term (b0=0.7, b1=0.2, kappa=10). Excited with a strike. Wave speed: 400
