Examples using plate simulations.

To get a taste of the musical capabilities of these simulations, listen to the song (Radiohead's The National Anthem) using plate reverb in the vocals (NA_og.wav), and compare to our recreation, solely using dry vocals and our plate reverb (NA_plate.wav). The Hammer_Strike.wav displays the capabilities of a hammer-membrane interaction. All of the following simulations are stiff, lossy membranes initialised with a raised cosine, to imitate specific instruments. With sampling rate Fs=40000 for all of them, these are the following variables which produce these sounds:

Bell
Variables: c=700; Lx=1; Ly=1; b0=0.5; b1=0.1; kappa=20;

Cymbal
Variables: c=800; Lx=3; Ly=3; b0=0.5; b1=0.001; kappa=50;

Metal Sheet
Variables: c=600; Lx=2; Ly=2; b0=0.1; b1=0.01; kappa=10;
